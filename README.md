# SASSY
SASSY-ARES stepper motors coded by HUmood

This branch was originally uploaded as a .raw and was integraterd into a branch by Mozburg

frankensteinStepper.ino added by Jonathan.

This file will be used to control vertical stepper motors for now. Here are its commands

T = Speed up
F = Slow down
R = reverse direction

*NOTE: The stepper motors will move even if the duty cycle for PWM is set to zero. Ensure motors are aligned and ready to move  before powering the arduino and uploading the code.
DOwnload Library branch for headers
